	<p>I made a music video involving the spirits of Nebleuya and its forest animals. I felt that a music video would do the best job of  communicating both the characteristics of the forest and what its inhabitants like to do. My inspiration for this project was based on the audio assignment I did where it sounded as if you were walking through the Nebleuyan forest and stumbled upon the spirits celebrating.  I wanted to create a visual for what someone may see when they finally get to what is inferred to be the destination that was at the end of the audio clip: the spirits playing around and  having fun. I used Audacity and Adobe After Effects to create the music video. I used audio clips of birds and cicadas from freesound.org  to add scenic background noise and mixed it with a dreamy song, Heaven or Las Vegas by the Cocteau Twins,  which overall encapsulates the type of music the spirits like to create and listen to. For the After Effects portion of my music video, I utilized the scale, position, and rotation features to mimic the movement of the spirits flying around, the frog jumping, the duck swimming, etc as shown.
